        <h4>Boid for Twitter</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">This is the first major project I had worked on. I had originally been working on another
            Twitter app called <em>Peeper</em> as an experiment, but <a target="_blank"

                Oakley</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gmph">Graham MacPhee</a> contacted me over
            email with design mockups and ideas for a new Twitter application for Android. I became their coder and we
            worked on Boid for quite some time while it spread like a virus and got almost 50,000 downloads. <a
                    target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kennydude">Joe
                Simpson</a> joined our team as another coder to help me out. We eventually had to take the project down
            from Google Play because Twitter changed their API policies and Boid became too much to maintain and update.

        <h4>Material Camera</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">Video recording is one of the hardest things to do for Android developers. Compatibility is
            very inconsistent among many different devices (due to different Android versions, how manufacturers mount
            camera sensors, etc.). This library is a result of research and testing done during development of
            SkillFitness. The project is

        <h4>DragSelectRecyclerView</h4>

        <h4>Material CAB</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">This library is a solution to an issue I had in Cabinet. The stock contextual action bar
            (selection mode) on Android is limited in placement and dynamic customization (for Cabinet's theme engine).
            This library allows the CAB to be dynamically themed and placed wherever you like. It can be <a
